# JSON Schema Files
AKM uses JSON schema files files that express the format of AKM data objects. 
([JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)) 

 It is the intent that this schema can be used to:

- Document the types and structure of AKM objects and properties
- Validate the structures and values in AKM data objects
- Leverage widely-available JSON and JSON Schema tooling

At this stage, all document types and properties are contained in a single **DRAFT** file: automotive_knowledge_model.json

Remaining work includes:

- Ensure the JSON Schema documents can be used to validate JSON files.
- Organize the JSON Schema documents into the most efficient, extensible, and understandable set of files and folders
